This folder contains the details of developing Generative adversarial network to restorate fluorescence lifetime images with few photons.
# FLIM Images Restoration using GAN CNN
## 1. Simulated dataset generation
Two datasets with different photon numbers (peak of the decay curve) will be generated using the same a1, a2, t1, t2

1.1 Ideal FLIM Images (photon number at the peak position > 80)
- Fitting Peak 5 ~ 25
- Normalized percentage a1 = 0.65 ~ 0.85 Real a1 = 3 ~ 20
- Normalized percentage a2 = 0.15 ~ 0.35 Real a2 = 1 ~ 8.75
- t1 = 0.15 ~ 0.45
- t2 = 1.5 ~ 3.5
1.2 FLIM with fewer photons and low SNR
- Fitting Peak 1 ~ 5
- Normalized percentage a1 = 0.65 ~ 0.85 Real a1 = 0.65 ~ 4.25
- Normalized percentage a2 = 0.15 ~ 0.35 Real a2 = 0.15 ~ 1.75
- t1 = 0.15 ~ 0.45
- t2 = 1.5 ~ 3.5
1.3 Notes
- Time: 0 – 12.5ns with 256 time frames
- Use the same a1, a2 (percentage), and t1, t2 values to generate TPSF images.
- The real a1 and a2 of the ideal FLIM are five times the real a1 and a2 of the FLIM with low SNR
- The TPSF images were generated by the equation of α_1 e^(-t/τ_1 )+ α_2 e^(-t/τ_2 ) , and then convoluted with IRF, and added the Poisson noises.
- The MINIST dataset (28 x 28) was applied as the original mask.
